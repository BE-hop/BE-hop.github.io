Hi, I’m **liu.ruyuan** — a designer, AI tinkerer, and hip-hop dancer who loves blending technology with storytelling. By day I shape landscape and interaction projects; by night I explore creative coding workflows that make expression more joyful and accessible.

On this site you’ll find:

1. Experiments with AI-assisted design tools;
2. Notes from real-world projects and retrospectives;
3. Training logs from the dance floor and reflections on body awareness;
4. Ideas, sketches, and anything that sparks curiosity.

Feel free to reach out via the social links in the sidebar. Let’s learn, create, and collaborate together.
