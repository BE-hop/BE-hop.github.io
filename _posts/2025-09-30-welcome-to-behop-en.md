This is the first post on the new site, confirming that the theme and content structure have migrated under my personal brand. From here, I will keep notes on:

- learning notes on AI and design tools;
- inspirations from landscape design and spatial experience;
- training insights and stage stories as a Hip-Hop dancer;
- workflows that help ideas land in the real world.

You can find social links in the sidebar or subscribe via RSS. Feel free to leave a comment about what you'd like to see, and I'm always open to collaboration.

Stay creative!
