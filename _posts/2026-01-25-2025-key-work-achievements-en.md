## Capability and collaboration leap

- **Rhino + Grasshopper**: Reached a new level; workflow efficiency and visual expression became more stable.
- **Team collaboration**: Gradually familiar with team and company structures, completing the transition from understanding to collaboration.

In real practice, I can better identify the issues and needs of different "seats".
Solving problems and meeting needs is what creates value.

## Next steps

- Integrate **AI** more deeply into the workflow to push integration at the concept stage.
- Strengthen **systems thinking** and **"AI × Design"** as core capabilities.
